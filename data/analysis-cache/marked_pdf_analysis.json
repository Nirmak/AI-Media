    "plotSummary": "Kara's fall during an accident at the academy hall leads to a confrontation with Rota, who reveals Vanir's involvement in her injury. Meanwhile, the narrator finds herself in the wildlands, where she encounters three golden dragon eggs hidden beneath claws. A winged creature approaches them, creating tension as the narrator flees in panic. The protagonist begins her struggle against this creature, facing severe physical harm each time it attacks. However, when she races to save an egg that is about to be destroyed by a dragon mother, she narrowly escapes with only minor injuries. This moment of saving the egg brings a resolution or turning point as she later sees the dragon mother who protects her eggs, prompting introspection.\n\nThe ground rumbles as the dragon lands nearby, and the narrator feels fear in her head, questioning why she is there despite the danger. The narrative concludes with the narrator acknowledging readers' support and encouragement, along with an announcement of her books achieving Amazon bestseller rankings, symbolizing a turning point in her journey toward self-discovery and community connection.",
